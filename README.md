# Workshop 2

## Instructions:
Open the provided Jupyter notebook `divincenzo_criteria_lab-2.ipynb`. It contains explanations and starter code with sections marked for you to complete. Fill in the missing code where indicated. The solutions have been provided if you wish to refer to them.

You can work on this locally with Jupyter or use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) if you prefer a cloud-based environment.

## Submission:
Your submission should be the completed notebook, `divincenzo_criteria_lab-2.ipynb`. Make sure to save your changes before committing.\
*(Note: This will not be graded - you can refer to the solutions if you want to judge your code)*

## Autograder:
After you commit and push, there will be a ✅ or ❌ next to your latest commit (or go to the Actions tab) to see if your submission format is correct. The autograder only verifies that your output is in the correct format - it does not check correctness!
